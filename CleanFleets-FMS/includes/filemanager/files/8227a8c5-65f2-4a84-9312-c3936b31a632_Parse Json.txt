Want value of Last to be shown in textbox, so i tried to parse it with "Newtonsoft" as follows:

  Dim jsonArray As JArray = JArray.Parse(rawresp)
    For Each item As JObject In jsonArray
        textboxLast.Text = item.SelectToken("Last").ToString

    Next
But getting error :(

Dim json As String = rawresp
Dim jsonObject As Newtonsoft.Json.Linq.JObject = Newtonsoft.Json.Linq.JObject.Parse(json)
Dim jsonArray As JArray = jsonObject("result")

For Each item As JObject In jsonArray
    textboxLast.Text = item.SelectToken("Last").ToString
Next
It has to do with the format of the JSON. it is not an array, but an object that contains an array, so you have to first parse the object, and then take the array out of it to parse properly. You missed that one extra step, which I added in above code snippet

just the first two lines, and then this: textboxLast.Text = jsonObject("result")("Currency") – Leo Muller Jan 30 at 11:54
