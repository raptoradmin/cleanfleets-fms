		<p>06/29/10<br>&nbsp;<br>Hello everyone<br>&nbsp;<br>I met with Sean last night 
		and as a result, there were several modifications identified that need 
		to be made to the CleanFleets system. One of those changes was the 
		ability for the system to accommodate the need to have a record of 
		annual miles and hours for the vehicle and/or engines.<br>&nbsp;<br>After 
		spending quite some time last night contemplating what changes I need to 
		make to do this, I find this to be a more challenging task than I first 
		anticipated. The reason for this is because an engine is inventoried 
		separately from the chassis.<br>&nbsp;<br>I first considered just moving the 
		MILEAGE FIELD and HOURS FIELD from Vehicle to Engine, however, miles do 
		count toward the vehicle chassis so mileage really needs to stay with 
		Vehicle. This begs the question whether or not mileage applies to the 
		engine or do only hours apply to engine?<br>&nbsp;<br>In any event, this will 
		require adding two new tables to the system:<br>&nbsp;<br>CF_Engines_Hours<br>
		CF_Vehicles_Mileage<br>&nbsp;<br>Unless told otherwise, I plan to include 
		both the mileage and hours in both tables just to cover any eventuality. 
		We need to do this in case of that rare event that one engine is moved 
		from one vehicle to another. The vehicle it was removed FROM needs to 
		still be able to show Mileage and the Engines need to be able to have a 
		record of Hours. CARB may also require the mileage be applied to the 
		engine as well as hours thus, just keep both miles and hours associated 
		with both the chassis and the engine.<br>&nbsp;<br>The other major item is 
		the use of a hand held device to inventory fleets. To enable the current 
		data system to manage records from the hand held devices, I will also be 
		adding a new field to each of the following tables:</p>
		<p class="auto-style1">CF_Vehicles</p>
		<p class="auto-style2">IDVehiclesHH</p>
		<p class="auto-style1">CF_Engines</p>
		<p class="auto-style2">IDEnginesHH</p>
		<p class="auto-style1">CF_DECs</p>
		<p class="auto-style2">IDDECsHH</p>
		<p class="auto-style1">CF_Images</p>
		<p class="auto-style2">IDImagesHH</p>
		<p>This field will be populated by the ID field generated by the Hand 
		Held system ID in order to add records back once a vehicle has been 
		inventoried. What I recommend is that each installation of the hand held 
		software have a unique identifier so we can distinguish one from 
		another, then combine that identifier with an inserted record ID so that 
		the field contains the hand held identifier AND the incremented ID.<br>&nbsp;<br>
		My recommendation to begin the process of inventory by hand held would 
		be that the user must first create an Account, Terminal, and a Fleet. 
		Once the Fleet is created, I can include a button to send the Fleet ID 
		to the hand held process.</p>
		<p>Here is what we will need back from the hand held:</p>
		<p class="auto-style1">Either</p>
		<p class="auto-style2">One to One records for Vehicles, Engines, DECs, 
		and Images</p>
		<p class="auto-style1">Or</p>
		<p class="auto-style2">One to One records for Engines not in a vehicle 
		with a DECS attached, and Images</p>
		<p class="auto-style1">Or</p>
		<p class="auto-style2">Single records for</p>
		<p class="auto-style3">Vehicles without engines and Images</p>
		<p class="auto-style3">Engines not attached to a vehicle and Images</p>
		<p class="auto-style3">DECs not attached to an engine and Images</p>
		<p>In ALL cases the Fleet ID should be added to each Vehicle, Engine, 
		and/or DECS record because we have to keep track of what fleet each one 
		belongs to because each one is inventoried separately.<br>&nbsp;<br>These are 
		major changes to the current application. It is going to take me some 
		time to redo the logic for the two new tables and how to manage the 
		records added for mileage and hours.<br>&nbsp;<br>Once I have reconfigured 
		the database by adding the new tables and fields, I will create a new 
		table dictionary and send it out.<br>&nbsp;<br>Give me a call on my cell at 
		(714) 313-7539 if you have any questions.</p>
